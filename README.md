## Overview
This lesson covers importing your `.glb` car model into Godot, setting up its collision, materials, and adding nodes like `VehicleWheel`. Additional objects like ramps are also set up.

## Steps

### 1. Importing the Car:
- **Import the `.glb` file into Godot.**
- **Ensure the import settings are correctly configured for your car model.**
  - Verify that the scale, orientation, and materials are correctly imported.

### 2. Collision Setup:
- **Add collision shapes to your car, ensuring they match the car's geometry.**

### 3. Material Setup:
- **Apply the imported materials to the car's mesh.**
  - Make sure that the car's materials look as intended in the Godot environment.
- **Adjust material settings in Godot for better visual fidelity.**
  - Tweak settings like specularity, roughness, and emission to match your desired look.

### 4. Node Setup:
- **Add `VehicleWheel` nodes to each wheel of the car.**
  - Ensure the nodes are correctly positioned relative to the wheels.
- **Add ramp objects in `Node3D` and attach the script.**
  - Set the script variables as needed for the car.
- **Set up input keys for car movement in Godot's project settings.**
  - Configure inputs like acceleration, braking, and steering.
- **Adjust the weightage of the car in the inspector.**
  - Set the physical weight of the car to affect its physics behavior in the environment.
