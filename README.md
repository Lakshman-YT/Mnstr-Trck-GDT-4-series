*Branch:* audio-and-gui-setup

## Overview
This lesson covers setting up audio for the car's acceleration, brakes, and hits, along with environment node settings and other GUI updates in Godot.

## Steps

### 1. Audio Import:
- *Import the audio as a loop forward.*
  - Do this in the import section located beside the scene tree section.
  - Ensure the audio is seamless to avoid cracks during playback.

### 2. Pitch and Acceleration:
- *Use a 2D curve to control pitch scaling for the acceleration.*
  - Set this up in the inspector of the updated script to ensure the car's acceleration sound plays smoothly and realistically.

### 3. Additional GUI Updates:
- *Implement any remaining GUI elements as needed.*
  - This might include updating the health bar, speedometer, or other visual elements to reflect the car's status during gameplay.
