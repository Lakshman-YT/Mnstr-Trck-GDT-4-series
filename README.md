*Branch:* blender-car-setup

## Overview
In this lesson, you'll learn how to set up a car model in Blender, including creating wheels, materials for lights, mirrors, and the car body, and an armature for suspension using weights and vertices. The car will then be exported as a .glb file for use in Godot.

## Steps

### 1. Car Model Setup:
- *Create or import your car model in Blender.*
  - Separate the car body and wheels into different objects.
  - Ensure the car model is properly scaled and oriented.

### 2. Material Setup:
- *Create materials for the car's body, lights, and mirrors.*
  - Assign the appropriate materials to each part of the car.

### 3. Suspension Armature:
- *Add an armature to the car for suspension purposes.*
  - Assign weights to the suspension vertices to simulate suspension behavior.
- *Rename armature bones properly.*
  - Ensure that bone names are clear and descriptive, making them easier to identify and assign later.

### 4. Exporting the Model:
- *Ensure all objects and materials are correctly set up.*
  - Double-check that everything is in place for the export.
- **Export the car model as a .glb file, making sure to include all necessary components.**
