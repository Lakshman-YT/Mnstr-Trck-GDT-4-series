# Monster Truck Godot 4 Series

**Branch:** `world-building`

## Overview
This lesson focuses on creating a world environment in Godot using a combination of CSG boxes and textures to design the world, including obstacles and level design.

## Steps

### 1. CSG Box Creation:
- **Use CSG boxes to create the basic structure of your world (e.g., roads, ramps, obstacles).**
  - Utilize CSG boxes to lay out the foundation and pathways for your environment.
- **Adjust the size, position, and rotation of the CSG boxes as needed.**
  - Fine-tune the dimensions and alignment to fit your desired layout.

### 2. Texture Application:
- **Apply textures to the CSG boxes to create a realistic environment.**
  - Select appropriate textures for different surfaces like roads, walls, and ramps.
- **Ensure textures are properly UV mapped to avoid stretching.**
  - Check the UV mapping to ensure textures appear correctly on the surfaces.
